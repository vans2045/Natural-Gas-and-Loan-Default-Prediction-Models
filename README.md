# Quantitative Research Project – Natural Gas Commodity Trading & Credit Risk Analysis Model

Quantitative Research Project – Natural Gas Commodity Trading & Credit Risk Analysis

- Developed a time series forecasting model to predict natural gas prices, incorporating both a linear trend and seasonal variations to extrapolate historical data and project future prices.

- Engineered a prototype pricing model for commodity storage contracts by integrating cash flow analysis, injection/withdrawal scheduling, and storage cost parameters to estimate contract value.

- Built a credit risk analysis model to predict the probability of default on personal loans using borrower data, selecting key features and applying machine learning techniques.

- Designed a quantization method to bucket FICO scores by optimizing mean squared error and log-likelihood, enhancing the accuracy of default probability predictions.

- Validated models through comprehensive visualization and performance metrics, supporting strategic decision-making for trading desks and risk management.
